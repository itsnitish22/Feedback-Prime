## 🥁Introduction:
- Through the innovation in ML, we are now able to analyse and detect how a person feels during a conversation. Keeping this amazing feature in mind, we had the idea to utilize this feature within customer support, to understand how to improve the customer's experience.-
Our Goal Through **Feedback Prime** is to make this available to Many more companies to improve the Customer support service worldwide.

## 💡Inspiration:
- Customer Support is one of the most polarizing topic when Feedback is concerned. While many companies provide a feedback form, a fraction of it is filled, making it an incomplete dataset to understand where things can be improved.
- Similarly, even for customers, it'll be relatively less annoying to have to fill a feedback form after every customer call.
- We came up with the idea of Feedback Prime to let companies analyse their support calls and have the **Symbl.ai** ML model analyse how the customer was feeling throughout the conversation to understand where the majority of customers felt annoyed so that it can be improved upon.

## 💬 What it does:
- It takes the link for the media file from the user, and then analyse the emotions for each dialogue.
- After the Analysis, Our app labels each dialogue with an emoticon to symbolize the emotion.

##  🛠 How we built it
- Symbl.ai, Kotlin, XML, Postman, Figma, SawoLabs

## ❗Challenges we ran into:
- One of the First challenge was Debugging the Thread Conundrum, due to which our Main thread was being terminated before the callback of the network thread. 
- Secondly, we weren't able to Pass the auth headers in our API calls.

##❓ What's next for Feedback Prime
1. Able to add locally hosted media files. And support other media formats.
2. Next, we want to create a cross-platform service to work on a host of Operating Systems.
3. We also plan to add a Graphic visualization and Portable Document Format with the dataset and will be automated to send it to the company's e-mail, which can be used for Research and Company briefings.
