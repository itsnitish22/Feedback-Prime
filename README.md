## ü•ÅIntroduction:

- Through the innovation in ML, we are now able to analyse and detect how a person feels during a
  conversation. Keeping this amazing feature in mind, we had the idea to utilize this feature within
  customer support, to understand how to improve the customer's experience.- Our Goal Through **
  Feedback Prime** is to make this available to Many more companies to improve the Customer support
  service worldwide.

## üí°Inspiration:

- Customer Support is one of the most polarizing topic when Feedback is concerned. While many
  companies provide a feedback form, a fraction of it is filled, making it an incomplete dataset to
  understand where things can be improved.
- Similarly, even for customers, it'll be relatively less annoying to have to fill a feedback form
  after every customer call.
- We came up with the idea of Feedback Prime to let companies analyse their support calls and have
  the **Symbl.ai** ML model analyse how the customer was feeling throughout the conversation to
  understand where the majority of customers felt annoyed so that it can be improved upon.

## üí¨ What it does:

- It takes the link for the media file from the user, and then analyse the emotions for each
  dialogue.
- After the Analysis, Our app labels each dialogue with an emoticon to symbolize the emotion.

## üõ† How we built it

- Symbl.ai, Kotlin, XML, Postman, Figma, SawoLabs.

## ‚ùóChallenges we ran into:

- One of the First challenge was Debugging the Thread Conundrum, due to which our Main thread was
  being terminated before the callback of the network thread.
- Secondly, we weren't able to Pass the auth headers in our API calls.

## ‚ùì What's next for Feedback Prime

1. Able to add locally hosted media files. And support other media formats.
2. Next, we want to create a cross-platform service to work on a host of Operating Systems.
3. We also plan to add a Graphic visualization and Portable Document Format along with the dataset and
   will be automated to send it to the company's e-mail, which can be used for Research and Company
   briefings.
